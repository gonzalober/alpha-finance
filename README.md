# alpha-finance [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gonzalober/alpha-finance.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gonzalober/alpha-finance)

Alpha-Finance is a web application that allows the user see stock prices in real-time.

The aim of the project is:

- the creation of dashboards with historical prices evolution and some basic metric aggregators (mean, max, min, stddev, median).
- That the user has the option of building his/her own portfolio with a weighted allocation of its preference, showing some portfolio's performance data. Lastly, will be the inclusion of the option of doing a portfolio optimization (based on historic performance).

** Note: as it was built on an IEX free account was not possible to run the project on a SSE data flow **
